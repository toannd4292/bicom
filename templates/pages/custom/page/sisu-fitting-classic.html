              <h2 class="addGrit">Do THIS:</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Use water that is hot to the touch to activate your mouthguard</li>
              <li>Mold your SISU around all of your teeth (including molars)</li>
              <li>Mold and stretch the material to cover entire tooth surface area</li>
              <li>Suck in air gently, creating a snug but still comfortable fit</li>

          </div>
          <div class="fitting-columns">
              <h2 class="addGrit">Don't do this:</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Use boiling water to mold your SISU!</li>
              <li>Leave your back teeth exposed!</li>
              <li>Overly stretch the material, creating too-large perforations</li>
              <li>Suck-in air too enthusiastically, creating a fit that's too tight</li>

                data-mt-detrack-inspected="true">video tutorial</a>​ with your child</li>
            <li>Allow ample time for fitting (we recommend two days before needed if possible).</li>
            <li>​Identify the bite pad on the guard, and practice aligning it with the teeth before softening the guard for the first time.</li>
            <li>The guard is formed by using vacuum pressure (suction). Re-familiarize your child with the concept of suction; grab a straw and practice.</li>
