        </div>
        <div class="fitting-step braces-1">
          <p>SISU is a great mouth guard for braces! The SISU mouthguard for braces is thin and you can remold it as
            your teeth
            are shifting, but before you run for the bowl of hot water, we want to walk you through how to fit a
            mouthguard with
            braces. Please make sure to read through the rules below to help you with your fitting and avoid damaging
            your
            brackets:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fitting-step braces-2">
          <h2 class="addGrit">1. Use The Right Size</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="fitting-step braces-3">
          <p>All athletes wearing braces ages 7 and up must use the Aero Medium, Aero Large, or Max. (You cannot use
            Aero Small with braces)</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fitting-step braces-4">
          <h2 class="addGrit">2. Consider A Mouthguard For Your Bottom Teeth</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="fitting-step braces-5">
          <p>SISU Mouthguards can be fitted to the top or bottom teeth. If you have braces, we recommend that you buy an
            additional guard to fit on your bottom teeth to prevent your lips from getting cut on the brackets. *NFHS
            wrestling rules require a top and bottom mouthguard for braces </p>
        </div>
        <div class="fitting-step braces-6">
          <h2 class="addGrit">3. You Must Use A Barrier Between The Brackets And The Guard</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="fitting-step braces-7">
          <p>When fitting SISU with braces, you need to cover the brackets with dental wax or aluminum foil. SISU is a
            custom fit mouthguard that fits perfectly to your teeth. Without a barrier over the brackets, the SISU will
            create a vacuum tight seal around the brackets and be hard to get off. The good news is that you only need
            to use the barrier during the fitting process. Once fitted, you can wear the guard right over the braces. Be sure that the guard does not curve up and over the bracket where it will harden and become difficult to remove- block out the area above the bracket with dental wax.  
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="fitting-step braces-8">
          <h2 class="addGrit">4. You Should Work With Your Dental Professional</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="fitting-step braces-9">
          <p>Braces are an investment in time and money, so you want to do it right. During critical times when your
            teeth are undergoing rigorous adjustments, your orthodontist may recommend an alternative solution, so not
            to hinder the progress of your treatment. Work with your dental professional to help you fit, and re-fit,
            your SISU when you come in for your adjustments. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="fitting-step braces-10">
          <h2 class="addGrit">5. As Your Teeth Shift, You Should Refit The Guard</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="fitting-step braces-11">
          <p>As your teeth shift during the orthodontic treatment, the mouthguard should be adjusted to fit your new
            shape. The guard is remoldable for up to 20 times, so you can continue using it, as your teeth shift and
            move. Simply bring it with you for each adjustment and it can be re-fitted right in the office with a bit of
            hot water (and the barrier). No impressions required! </p>
        </div>
        <div class="fitting-step braces-12">
          <h2 class="addGrit">6. How Do I Remove A Guard That Is Stuck To My Braces?</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="fitting-step braces-13">
          <p>Please follow these steps to safely remove the guard:<br/>
            Gather the following tools: A cup of very hot water, cotton swabs, cotton balls, cotton gauze, a pair of
            tweezers, and a washcloth.<br/>
            Take care to protect the mouth to prevent burns due to hot water exposure! Use the washcloth or cotton gauze
            to absorb excess hot water when applying the soaked material to the guard.<br/>
            Begin by using the tweezers to apply hot water-saturated cotton swabs or cotton balls to the guard area
            surrounding the brackets, to soften the guard.<br/>
            As the guard softens, use the tweezers to slowly and gently, pull the guard away from the brackets. Focus on
            smaller areas, progressing until the guard can safely be removed. (Reheat the water as necessary to maintain
            the temperature needed to soften the guard.)</p>
