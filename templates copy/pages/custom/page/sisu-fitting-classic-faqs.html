<h1>SISU Mouthguard FAQs</h1>
<a id="whichguard" name="whichguard"></a>
<h2 class="question">Which guard should I get: Aero, Max, or GO?</h2>
<div class="answer">
<p>The choice of an Aero or Max depends on the level of protection you need.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.sisuguard.com/sisu-aero-mouth-guard/">Aero Guard</a> is our most popular guard. Offered in 3 sizes (Small, Medium, Large) Aero is the perfect choice for any athlete. Aero is 1.6 mm thin and is used by those who like the superior protection of a SISU Mouthguard, but prefer the thinner profile. Most commonly used in team sports such as: lacrosse, field hockey, basketball, football, hockey (with full cage helmet).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.sisuguard.com/sisu-max-mouth-guard/">Max Guard</a> is 2.4 mm thin and offers more protection than the Aero. It&rsquo;s generally used in sports that have a higher rate of direct facial contact and aggressive play. Most commonly used in: rugby, MMA, ice hockey (with visor helmet)</li>

<div class="answer">Please visit our <a href="https://www.sisuguard.com/fitting-instructions/">fitting page</a> for complete fitting instructions and a helpful video. <a id="longlast" name="longlast"></a></div>
<h2 class="question">How can I tell if my mouthguard is fitted properly?</h2>
<div class="answer">
<ul>
<li>If you mouthguard is fitted properly you should not be able to remove it with your tongue.</li>
<li>Do not stretch the holes! Stretching them can compromise the integrity of the guard and will void the dental warranty.</li>
<li>It's crucial that your teeth are properly aligned with the bite pad of the mouthguard, place them on the area where there are no perforations.</li>
<li>Your guard should cover the outer surfaces of your teeth and not the roof of your mouth.</li>
<li>With a preperly fitted SISU, you should be able to speak almost completely naturally.</li>

</ul>
</div>
<h2 class="question">When should I replace my SISU Mouthguard?</h2>
<div class="answer">We recommend you replace your SISU Mouthguard once a season or at the very minimum once a year. Keeping it clean and letting it dry before storing will keep the germs at bay and extend the life of the guard. Your SISU Mouthguard is covered by a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sisuguard.com/warranties-disclaimer/">limited&nbsp;dental warranty</a>&nbsp;up to $50,000 for up to 1 year after purchase.</div>
<h2 class="question">Can I wear a SISU Mouthguard with braces?</h2>
<div class="answer">SISU Mouthguards work great with braces because they can be remolded as teeth are shifting throughout treatment.&nbsp;In order to successfully fit your SISU Mouthguard, a protective barrier (such as dental wax) is needed to cover the brackets during the fitting process. We recommend having your orthodontist help with the fitting. Make sure to use a SISU Aero Medium or Large regardless of the child's ages. Do not use a SISU Aero Small with braces. Visit our <a href="https://www.sisuguard.com/fitting-with-braces/">braces page</a> for more information. <a id="remold" name="remold"></a></div>
<h2 class="question">Can I wear this mouthguard as a retainer?</h2>
<div class="answer">The SISU Mouthgaurd (SOVA Night Guard) should not be worn as a retainer and will not keep teeth from shifting, it is best to wear the retainer provided by your orthodontist.</div>
<h2 class="question">What if I want to remold my SISU Mouthguard?</h2>
<div class="answer">Your SISU Mouthguard is remoldable up to 20 times without losing its protective properties. Just put your guard in hot water (170â„‰) and watch it return to its original shape. <a id="smallmouth" name="smallmouth"></a></div>
<h2 class="question">I have a really small mouth&hellip; should I trim the mouthguard before fitting it?</h2>
<div class="answer">Do not trim your SISU Mouthguard. Instead, if you have a smaller mouth, size down to a SISU Aero Small mouthguard. With SISU, every part of the guard is important when it comes to getting the most protection out of your mouthguard: the perforations, the crumple zones, the boomerang shape. Not only will trimming the guard void any available dental warranty, but your teeth will be at a lot more risk for injury. <a id="verysmallmouth" name="verysmallmouth"></a></div>
<h2 class="question">But I still have a small mouth&hellip;should I purchase a SISU Small instead?</h2>
<div class="answer">By the time you turn 11, your jaw has fully formed. You&rsquo;ll need all the material provided in any of our adult mouthguards to provide you with the best protection. If you know you have a small mouth, size down to a SISU Aero Small.&nbsp;<a id="topbottom" name="topbottom"></a></div>
<h2 class="question">Do you have a mouthguard for the lower teeth?</h2>
<div class="answer">You can wear a SISU on both your top and bottom teeth, but most of our athletes prefer the comfort and strength that a single mouthguard provides. If you want protection for your lower teeth, we recommend using the <a href="https://www.sisuguard.com/sisu-aero-mouth-guard/">Aero Guard</a>&nbsp;(small)&nbsp;or <a href="https://www.sisuguard.com/sisu-go-mouth-guard/">SISU GO</a>. <a id="hard" name="hard"></a></div>
<h2 class="question">Can I wear a SISU on both the top and bottom teeth?</h2>
<div class="answer">Yes, the SISU mouthguard can be worn on both the top and bottom teeth for extra protection. If you want protection for your lower teeth, we recommend using the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sisuguard.com/sisu-aero-mouth-guard/">Aero Guard</a>&nbsp;(small)&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sisuguard.com/sisu-go-mouth-guard/">SISU GO</a>.</div>
<h2 class="question">Does my SISU contain any harsh chemicals?</h2>
<div class="answer">Our mouthguards do not contain any of the following chemicals: PVC, Latex, BPA, BPS or Phthalates. <a id="nightgrinding" name="nightgrinding"></a></div>
<h2 class="question">Can I wear SISU for night grinding?</h2>
<div class="answer">We recommend that you use our <a href="https://www.sovanightguard.com/">SOVA night guard </a>for grinding and clenching. SOVA is specifically engineered to diffuse and redistribute the forces of night grinding and clenching. SOVA doesn't go as high on the gum line, has a smaller profile &nbsp;and is much more comfortable than SISU for night time use. Its design is specific to night grinding and clenching. &nbsp;While&nbsp;SISU can be used at night, under no circumstances should SOVA be used as an athletic guard. <a id="concussion" name="concussion"></a></div>
<h2 class="question">Do mouthguards protect against concussions?</h2>
<div class="answer">It is a common misconception that mouth guards protect against concussions. <a href="https://blog.sisuguard.com/dr.-akervall-no-link-between-mouth-guards-and-concussions">No conclusive evidence exists that mouth guards can protect against concussions. What they can do, is protect against dental impact.</a> <a id="clean" name="clean"></a></div>

<div class="answer">The SISU Mouthguard does not offer the option of a strap or tether at this time.</div>
<h2 class="question">How do I remove a guard stuck to my braces?</h2>
<div class="answer">Please follow these steps to safely remove the guard. <br />Gather the following tools: A cup of very hot water, cotton swabs, cotton balls, cotton gauze, a pair of tweezers, and a washcloth. <br />Take care to protect the mouth to prevent burns due to hot water exposure! Use the wash cloth or cotton gauze to absorb excess hot water when applying the soaked material to the guard. <br />Begin by using the tweezers to apply hot water saturated cotton swabs or cotton balls to the guard area surrounding the brackets, to soften the guard.<br />As the guard softens, use the tweezers to slowly and gently, pull the guard away from the brackets. Focus on smaller areas, progressing until the guard can safely be removed. (Reheat the water as necessary to maintain the temperature needed to soften the guard.)</div>

<div class="answer">This product can expose you to Bisphenol A (BPA) that is listed in California under Proposition 65 as causing female reproductive toxicity BPA is a widely used chemical that is found in protective coatings in metal food and drink cans and bottle caps. In California. Consumers can decide on their own if they want to purchase or use the product. A Proposition 65 warning does not necessarily mean a product is in violation of any product-safety standards or requirements. A small amount of BPA-containing adhesive is used during assembly of the electronic components of the SisuSense mouth guard. During curing of the adhesive, the BPA is consumed, and the assembled electronic components are completely encased in a medical -grade thermoplastic polymer. This makes it highly unlikely that the user of the SisuSense mouth guard comes into direct contact with BPA.</div>
